# STM32L4R9I-DISCO Discovery board

## Overview

The 32L4R9IDISCOVERY Discovery kit is a complete demonstration and development platform for
STMicroelectronics Arm® Cortex®-M4 core-based STM32L4R9AI microcontroller.

Leveraging the innovative ultra-low-power oriented features, 640 Kbytes of embedded RAM, graphics performance (Chrom-ART Accelerator),
and DSI controller offered by the STM32L4R9AI, the 32L4R9IDISCOVERY Discovery kit enables users to easily prototype applications with
state-of-the-art energy efficiency, as well as stunning audio and graphics rendering with direct support for AMOLED DSI round LCD display.

For even more user-friendliness, the on-board ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger provides out-of-the-box programming and debugging capabilities.
